# BiLSTM_AUD
This repo contains the implementation of Active User Detection in NOMA networks for IoT 5G communication, using Deep Neural Networks such as Bi-LSTM. Works with time-series data of sender nodes to provide number of active users by calculating support of the device matrix. Implemented using Python.
